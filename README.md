# cc-by-data
Datasets available under CC-BY and/or OGL. These are either:

- subsets of data from the [By The Sword Linked wiki](https://github.com/drgavinr/btsl/) released separately under a more permissive licence
- separate datasets that were never imported to By The Sword Linked

See [delimited text documentation](https://github.com/drgavinr/cc-by-data/blob/main/delimited-text.md) for more details of file formats.

Where these datasets are partly or wholly under the Open Government Licence, this will be stated in their readme files.
