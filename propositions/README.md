## Introduction

The Propositions was a system of voluntary contributions to the parliamentarian war effort in the early part of the First Civil War. The system started with an ordinance of Parliament on 9 June 1642 which invited the public to loan money, plate, horses and arms.[^1] The ordinance promised that the value of all contributions, plus 8% interest for money, would be repaid on 'the Public Faith', but this phrase did not yet mean security against specific tax revenues, and it was not made clear when or how the loans would be repaid. The system was implemented and modified by many more orders from both houses of Parliament.[^2] The most important change was on 14 October 1642, when the threat of disarming and imprisoning non-contributors effectively made contributions compulsory.[^3] Later, non-contributors in and near London were liable for the 20th Part assessment, administered by the Committee for Advance of Money.[^4] In May 1643, a new 5th and 20th Part assessment was imposed on non-contributors in all areas controlled by Parliament.[^5] Assessment and collection were administered at county level, and the money was often spent at county level.

## Other documents

These sources have not been transcribed here but may be relevant to future research on the Propositions:

- Bodleian Library, [MS Tanner 63, ff. 51-](https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repositories/2/archival_objects/219726): list of subscriptions of horses, money, and plate by members of the House of Commons. Annotated transcript published in Vernon F. Snow and Anne Steele Young (eds) *Private Journals of the Long Parliament, 2 June to 17 September 1642* (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1992), pp. 466-480, [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt227263m.13). This is a list of what MPs promised, not necessarily what they actually brought in. At least some of the horses actually brought in are listed in the commissaries' account book in TNA, SP 28/131/3. The [Commons Journal](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/commons-jrnl/vol2) includes many reminders to MPs who had not yet brought in what they promised.
