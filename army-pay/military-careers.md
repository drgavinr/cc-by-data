# Military Careers

Parliamentarian financial and administrative records can help to reconstruct the careers of military units and some of the officers and soldiers who served in them. This page gives some notes, references, and examples. These are remnants of abandoned research projects and incidental discoveries. They are not comprehensive.

## Pay warrants

Salary payments for a whole unit were usually authorized by a warrant signed by a general or members of a committee. These warrants do not name any of the soldiers who were to be paid. The commanding officer of the unit was named on the warrant as the payee. The earliest and latest warrants for a commanding officer can give a range of dates within which he held that rank in that army. Some warrants explicitly say which officer succeeded another as commander of that unit. Commanding officers often delegated collecting the unit's pay to a junior officer. In these cases, the receipts incidentally give some information about junior officers' careers, which are otherwise difficult to trace because they are rarely named on warrants as payees in their own right. In a few special cases, junior officers or ordinary soldiers are named as individuals or small groups in pay warrants that do not refer to the whole unit.

Malcolm Wanklyn, *Reconstructing the New Model Army* (Helion, 2 volumes) uses pay warrants and other sources to construct detailed lists of units and commanding officers. Junior officers are included as far as they are known. Some information about pre-NMA service is given, but this is incidental to the main purpose of the book and is not exhaustive. Wanklyn has corrected many errors and omissions in Firth and Davies, *The Regimental History of Cromwell's Army*. Firth and Davies's work will soon be out of copyright but it should not be used because it is obsolete and misleading.

Alan Turton, *Chief Strength of the Army: Essex's Horse (1642â€“1645)* is a dictionary of cavalry troops in Essex's army arranged by commanding officer's name but with cross references to successors and predecessors where known. Includes junior officers as far as they can be known. This work is mostly reliable but could be expanded on.

These are some examples of pay warrants signed by the Earl of Essex that show succession of commanding officers:

- TNA, SP 28/1A, f. 226: Sir Sigismund Alexander was to take command of William St Leger's horse troop on 27 August 1642.
- TNA, SP 28/3A/3, f. 251: John Middleton succeeded as colonel of Lord Feilding's horse regiment by 9 November 1642.
- TNA, SP 28/6/3, f. 340: Gilbert Carr succeeded Charles Chichester as captain of a horse troop by 29 April 1643.
- TNA, SP 28/9, f. 188: Anthony Buller succeeded Richard Fiennes as captain of a horse troop by 25 August 1643.
- TNA, SP 28/9, f. 253: 26 August 1643: Thomas Wogan was paid for two horse troops, one formerly under Lord Grey of Wark, the other formerly under Captain Evelyn.

Payees of some pay warrants were soldiers' widows who were owed arrears of pay due to their late husbands. These are especially valuable because they give names of ordinary soldiers and the units they served in, as well as linking the soldiers to society by showing their marital status and the names of their wives. If the soldier was killed in a battle, these warrants can also confirm that their unit was present at that battle.

Most pay warrants are arranged in subseries in TNA, SP 28 by month and then by the general or committee that signed them. See [warrants](https://github.com/drgavinr/cc-by-data/tree/main/army-pay/warrants) for a catalogue of these groups of warrants at subseries level. These warrants have not been catalogued or indexed at item level.

### Miscellaneous warrant series

Among the main series of pay warrants are subseries of miscellaneous documents arranged by month. Sorting is based on the date when the document was created, but they often refer to much earlier events. Most of these documents are not warrants even though they are filed alongside warrants. They can include certificates and depositions giving information about military service of individual officers and soldiers.

See [warrants](https://github.com/drgavinr/cc-by-data/tree/main/army-pay/warrants) for a catalogue of these groups of documents at subseries level. These documents have not been catalogued or indexed at item level.

## Accounts

See [essex-army-accounts](https://github.com/drgavinr/cc-by-data/tree/main/army-pay/essex-army-accounts) for transcripts of treasurers' accounts of payments for Essex's army. The information given in each entry is less detailed than pay warrants, but there are entries for transactions for which the original warrant has been lost.

Commanding officers were required to submit accounts of their receipts and expenditure to the Committee for Taking Accounts of the Whole Kingdom, and sometimes made accounts for more specific purposes. Many (but probably only a minority) of these accounts survive in TNA, SP 28. It is important to note that these are later copies drawn up to be submitted to the committee and not original working documents. They usually list ranks held and units commanded, with start and end dates. Names of junior officers are often included incidentally but are rarely complete. Occasionally an account names ordinary soldiers who served in a unit but this is much less common. Accounting for losses of arms and horses sometimes reveals names of soldiers who deserted or changed sides.

Some accounts are well arranged and catalogued, but others are hard to find because they are in unexpected places and do not have item-level descriptions:

- [SP 28/126-139](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C20473): subseries of officers' accounts. Arranged by county but some accounts are also relevant to field armies. The catalogue gives detailed and accurate item-level descriptions.
- [SP 28/140](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C193217): accounts mostly relating to Essex's army, Lord Fairfax's northern army, and the New Model Army.
- [SP 28/143-147](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C91603): this subseries contains some very important accounts but is wrongly catalogued at piece level as 'Miscellaneous receipts and vouchers' and has no item-level descriptions.

These are some accounts that have been found in other boxes of SP 28:

- SP 28/2B/3, f. 522: Account of mounting money for Essex's Lifeguard under Sir Philip Stapleton.
- SP 28/11, f. 136: Account of pay for Captain William Hill, captain of horse in Waller's Army 1643-03-28 to 1643-12-11.

- SP 28/38/6, f. 624: Part of account of Lt-Col Thorpe, Waller's Army, including horses and saddles bought in London.
- SP 28/38/6, f. 626: List of horses delivered to Lionel Copley (captain of horse, Essex's army).
- SP 28/41/5, f. 483: Account of Captain Hercules Hannay for raising and recruiting his troop. Mentions being taken prisoner at Chirk Castle, 1645.

## Accounts Committee records

Records of the Committee for Taking Accounts itself are in [TNA, SP 28/252-260](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C20477).

### Certificates of account

SP 28/252 and SP 28/253A each contain, among other things, a bound book of copies of certificates of account. Each certificate refers to one officer and gives a list of his ranks and units with exact dates of service. As far as I know, these books have never been transcribed or indexed in full.

### Depositions

The Accounts Committee papers also include some depositions relating to officers' accounts, especially where there were accusations of fraud. These can supply names of junior officers and ordinary soldiers, and incidental details about life in the army. Some of these documents are in SP 28/255. There may be more in other boxes of Accounts Committee papers from SP 28/252-260. Some strays also occur in miscellaneous warrant subseries.

## E 121

[TNA, E 121](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C6567) is a collection of documents relating to the sale of Crown lands to pay soldiers' arrears. This series is well known and I have not looked at it in detail. These notes are based on a preliminary investigation.

The series is in 5 physical boxes numbered E 121/1 to E 121/5. These are not orderable references and they do not show up in the ordering system or the catalogue.

Each box contains several bundles numbered E 121/1/1 to E 121/5/7 and arranged by the county in which the Crown lands were located. In most cases, one bundle corresponds to one county but there are exceptions. Descriptions in the catalogue show which counties are covered by which bundle. These are orderable references. If you order one bundle, such as E 121/1/1, what is produced in the reading room may be just that bundle or the whole box. This may vary according to whether the bundle is near the top or bottom of the box, or may be a result of changes of practice behind the scenes, or may be random. Practice may have changed since I was last at Kew in 2019.

There are 40 bundles in total. Size of bundles varies from very thin  to very thick (E 121/5/5, Yorkshire, is especially thick). An experienced photographer could probably copy the entire series in 1-2 days.

Within each bundle are multiple certificates assigning a piece of property, usually to the colonel of a regiment, and giving details of the property. Each certificate is usually followed by a list of soldiers with the amounts of arrears they were owed. It must be stressed that the series does not add up to a snapshot of the whole of the New Model Army or any other army at any one time. The lists include only soldiers who were still serving in the NMA in the 1650s *and* were still owed arrears of pay for earlier service, often in another parliamentarian army before they joined the NMA.

The lists of soldiers have headings for regiments and troops or companies of the New Model Army, known by the name of the commanding officer at the time when the certificate was issued. Entries are numbered and each page can contain around 10 entries, although some have fewer. The total number of pages is unknown. Each entry gives the soldier's name and the rank and unit for which he is owed arrears. Units cover local forces and garrisons as well as major field armies. Dates of service are not usually given. The right hand column gives the amount of money due for arrears. Some consecutive entries can refer to the same person if he is owed for different ranks or units.

## Wills

Some officers who died in service have wills proved by the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. Registered copies are held by TNA in series PROB 11 and available online. These are some examples that have been positively identified, or are possibilities:

- [PROB 11/190/485 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D984161): Edwyn Sandys. Colonel of horse in Essex's army, mortally wounded at Powick Bridge, 1642. Names of executors (Sir Henry Heyman and John Glynn) match statement from Jos. Cokayne about money paid to the estate of Colonel Edwin Sandys (TNA, SP 28/43/1, f. 170). Proved 1642-12-30.
- [PROB 11/193/145 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D857909): John Gower. Saddler of St Katherine Cree parish, London. Supplied saddles to Essex county committee and other parliamentarian forces. Warrants for saddles sometimes call him Captain Gower. May or may not be the Captain Gower from Manchester's foot regiment. His widow, Jane, continued the business and supplied the New Model Army. Proved 1645-05-09.
- [PROB 11/190/460 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D984175): Edward Berry. Could be the cavalry officer in Essex's army killed at Powick Bridge, 1642. Proved 1642-12-14.
- [PROB 11/192/568 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D857641): nuncupative will of George Austin, made at Balliol College, Oxford, 1643. May or may not be the London merchant who served as captain of horse in Essex's army and was taken prisoner in 1642. Proved 1645-03-31.
- [PROB 11/193/156 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D857877): nuncupative will of Jecamiah Abercromy (but nearly all modern historians and archivists have mistranscribed his forename as 'Jeremiah') made after he was mortally wounded in 1645. Captain of horse and dragoons in Essex's army. Served at capture of Hillesden House and married one of the occupants, Susan Denton. Proved 1645-05-13.
- [PROB 11/206/135 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D861074): nuncupative will of Colonel John Meldrum made after he was mortally wounded at Cheriton, 1644. Proved 1648-11-16.
- [PROB 11/195/322 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D876084): John Gunter. Probably the major of Essex's horse regiment killed at Chalgrove Field, 1643. Proved 1646-03-05.
- [PROB 11/192/8 ](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D857131): Arthur Goodwin of Upper Winchendon, Buckinghamshire. MP and colonel of horse in Essex's army. Death in 1643 probably not combat-related. Proved 1644-11-11.

Where there is a written will, the original in PROB 10 should contain the testator's signature, which could be matched to other documents, such as receipts for pay (obviously this can't be done for nuncupative wills). I have only done this for John Gower, which confirms that the will belongs to the saddler who supplied the Essex county committee. I have not found a receipt for pay which would show whether he was the captain in Manchester's foot regiment.

Searches for PCC wills for these officers returned no likely matches:

- Valentine Walton junior, captain of horse in Eastern Association army, killed at Marston Moor, 1644.
- Charles Essex, colonel of foot in Essex's army, killed at Edgehill, 1642.
- John Boswell, major of horse in Essex's army, mortally wounded at Cheriton, 1644.
- John Dalbier, cavalry officer and engineer, killed 1648 after changing sides.
- Alexander Douglas, major of horse in Essex's army, mortally wounded at Powicke Bridge, 1642.
- Francis Dowett/Duett, former captain and major of horse in Essex's and Waller's armies, killed November 1645 after changing sides.
- John Hammond, captain of horse in Essex's army, died winter 1642/43.
